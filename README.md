# LateList
An simple example MySQL + Node.js CRUD app. Hopefully, this sample app can help people trying to learn Node.js with simple MySQL integration.

Includes a `list` page, `/add` page, `/edit` page and `/delete` function.

# Installation
Go to `/`  and run the following:

	npm build
	npm install

# Execution

Make sure you update `app.js` with your local MySQL settings. The settings in the repo are default settings for XAMPP/MAMP/WAMP, etc.
